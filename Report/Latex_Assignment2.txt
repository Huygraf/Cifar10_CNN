\section{Overview and Objectives}
In recent years, image classification and processing have become fundamental tasks in the field of computer vision and machine learning[cite: 7]. The ability to automatically recognize and categorize visual information is critical in various real-world applications such as facial recognition, autonomous driving, medical imaging, and security systems[cite: 8]. Among the many techniques used to solve these tasks, neural networks-especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)-have proven to be highly effective due to their ability to extract and learn hierarchical features from images[cite: 9].


This project aims to explore the concepts of image classification and image processing through the practical implementation and evaluation of two types of neural networks: a basic Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)[cite: 10]. The CIFAR-10 dataset, a widely-used benchmark in computer vision, serves as the foundation for our experiments, providing a diverse collection of labeled images representing various object categories commonly encountered in real-world visual recognition tasks[cite: 11].


The main objectives of this assignment are[cite: 12]:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To understand the differences between fully connected networks and convolutional architectures in handling image data.
    \item To build, train, validate, and test both MLP and CNN models using the PyTorch deep learning framework[cite: 13].
    \item To evaluate model performance using learning curves and confusion matrices[cite: 14].
    \item To analyze and compare the effectiveness of the two approaches in the context of image classification[cite: 15].
\end{itemize}


The ultimate goal of this assignment is not only to develop a functional image classification system but also to enhance our understanding of image data, strengthen our ability to design and evaluate neural network models, and develop the skills to interpret and communicate visual recognition results effectively[cite: 16]. These are essential competencies for anyone aiming to work in computer vision, machine learning, or AI-driven application development[cite: 17].

\section{Acknowledgements}


We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Mr. Kim Nguyen Bach, instructor of the Python Programming course, for his dedicated teaching and continuous support throughout the semester[cite: 18]. His guidance has been instrumental in helping us understand both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of Python in the field of artificial intelligence[cite: 19].


Through this assignment, we had the opportunity to engage deeply with key concepts in image processing and classification[cite: 20]. By implementing and comparing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we not only strengthened our understanding of neural network architectures but also gained valuable experience in model training, evaluation, and performance analysis[cite: 21]. Working with the CIFAR-10 dataset allowed us to confront real-world challenges such as image normalization, overfitting, and hyperparameter tuning-skills that are essential in the development of modern computer vision systems[cite: 22].


This project also helped us improve our collaboration and project management skills[cite: 23]. From planning the workflow to debugging code and interpreting results, we learned to communicate effectively, divide responsibilities, and solve problems as a team[cite: 24]. These are crucial abilities for any future career in software development, machine learning, or research[cite: 25].


While we strived to complete the assignment as thoroughly as possible, we recognize that there is always room for growth[cite: 26]. We welcome constructive feedback from our instructor and peers, and we look forward to applying these lessons to future projects[cite: 27]. Thank you very much for your support and encouragement!

\section{Introduction to MLP and CNN}


\subsection{Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)}


\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Screenshot 2025-05-24 113932.png} % Requires mlp_structure.png
    \caption{Structure of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).}
    \label{fig:mlp_structure}
\end{figure}


The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of feedforward neural network widely used in machine learning. The basic structure of an MLP includes at least three layers: an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer[cite: 30]. Except for the input layer, each neuron in the network performs computations and applies a nonlinear activation function to increase the network's ability to learn complex relationships in the data[cite: 31].


\textbf{Structure of MLP[cite: 32]:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Input Layer:} This layer receives the input data. For image data, the image is usually flattened from a 2D matrix (or 3D if multiple color channels) into a one-dimensional vector[cite: 32]. Each element of this vector corresponds to a neuron in the input layer[cite: 33]. This layer does not perform any computation but simply passes the data to the first hidden layer[cite: 34].
    \item \textbf{Hidden Layers:} Each hidden layer consists of neurons fully connected to the previous layer[cite: 35]. Each connection carries a unique weight, along with a bias term for each neuron[cite: 36]. The weighted sum of inputs is passed through a nonlinear activation function such as ReLU, Sigmoid, or Tanh[cite: 37]. Increasing the number of hidden layers or neurons can improve the network's representation capacity but also increases complexity and the risk of overfitting[cite: 39].
    \item \textbf{Output Layer:} The output layer is the last layer of the network and generates the predictions[cite: 40]. It is also fully connected to the preceding hidden layer[cite: 41]. The number of neurons in the output layer depends on the desired output, for example, 10 neurons for a 10-class classification problem (like CIFAR-10)[cite: 42]. The softmax activation function is commonly used here to produce a probability distribution, helping the model make more accurate predictions[cite: 43].
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Activation Functions[cite: 44]:}
Activation functions play a critical role in enabling the network to learn nonlinear mappings[cite: 44]. In MLPs, ReLU ($f(x) = \max(0, x)$) is commonly used because it is simple and effective in training[cite: 45]. Without nonlinear activation functions, no matter how many layers the network has, it would be equivalent to a simple linear model[cite: 46].


\textbf{Training and Applications[cite: 47]:}
MLPs are trained using backpropagation combined with optimizers such as SGD or Adam to update weights based on a loss function[cite: 47]. Although MLPs are powerful for tabular or sequential data, they have a major limitation when working with images: flattening images destroys spatial relationships between pixels, making the model unable to exploit geometric structures like edges, boundaries, or shapes[cite: 48].


\subsection{Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)}


\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Screenshot 2025-05-24 114001.png} % Requires cnn_structure.png
    \caption{Structure of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)[cite: 49].}
    \label{fig:cnn_structure}
\end{figure}


The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning architecture specifically designed for data with spatial structure such as images[cite: 49]. CNNs can learn local features and aggregate them into higher-level abstract features through multiple stacked layers[cite: 50]. This allows CNNs to achieve very high performance in computer vision tasks like image classification, object detection, and face recognition[cite: 51].


\textbf{Main components of CNN[cite: 52]:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Convolutional Layer:} This is the core layer of CNNs, where filters (kernels) slide over the input image to extract local features such as edges, corners, or textures[cite: 53]. Each filter is learned during training and produces a feature map[cite: 54]. Important parameters include:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Stride: the step size of the filter as it moves across the image[cite: 55].
            \item Padding: adding fake pixels at the edges to control output size[cite: 56].
            \item Number of filters: determines the depth of output and the number of features learned[cite: 57].
        \end{itemize}
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Screenshot 2025-05-24 114115.png} % Requires convolution_op.png
            \caption{Convolution Operation[cite: 58].}
            \label{fig:conv_op}
        \end{figure}
    \item \textbf{ReLU Activation Function:} ReLU is applied after each convolution operation to introduce nonlinearity into the network[cite: 58]. It speeds up training and helps prevent the vanishing gradient problem by keeping positive values and discarding negative ones[cite: 59].
    \item \textbf{Pooling Layer:} Pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of feature maps, which decreases the number of parameters and computational cost[cite: 60]. Common pooling methods are[cite: 61]:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Max Pooling: selects the maximum value in each region[cite: 61].
            \item Average Pooling: calculates the average value in each region[cite: 62].
        \end{itemize}
        A typical configuration uses a $2\times2$ window with stride 2, halving the width and height of the input[cite: 63].
    \item \textbf{Fully Connected Layer:} After convolution and pooling layers, the output is flattened and passed to fully connected layers for classification[cite: 64]. Each neuron here connects to every neuron in the previous layer[cite: 65]. The final layer usually has as many neurons as the number of classes[cite: 66].
\end{itemize}


\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Screenshot 2025-05-24 114046.png} % Requires simple_cnn_structure.png
    \caption{A typical CNN architecture[cite: 67].}
    \label{fig:simple_cnn}
\end{figure}


\textbf{Standard and Effective Architectures:}
Modern CNN architectures may have from 3 up to more than 10 convolutional layers, depending on the problem complexity and data size[cite: 67]. With large datasets like ImageNet, famous CNN models such as LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet have been developed, achieving very high accuracy in competitions like ILSVRC[cite: 68]. Today, CNNs are the dominant tool in image processing thanks to their hierarchical feature learning, computational efficiency, and superior accuracy compared to traditional models[cite: 69].

\section{Introduction to CIFAR-10}


CIFAR-10 is a standard dataset commonly used for image classification tasks[cite: 71]. It contains 60,000 color images, each with a resolution of $32\times32$ pixels[cite: 72]. The dataset is divided into 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class[cite: 73]. These classes include: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. The classes are mutually exclusive[cite: 74]. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images[cite: 75].

# Step 3 - models & utilities
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix


class MLP(nn.Module):
    """Simple 3-layer Multi-Layer Perceptron for CIFAR-10 (image flattened)."""
    def __init__(self, input_size: int = 3*32*32, num_classes: int = 10):
        super().__init__()
        self.net = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Flatten(),
            nn.Linear(input_size, 1024), nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.Linear(1024, 512), nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.Linear(512, num_classes),
        )


    def forward(self, x):

Best validation accuracy achieved was 77.79\% (at epoch 9)[cite: 118]. The model showed strong generalization, with validation accuracy improving steadily[cite: 119].


\subsection{Model Evaluation Procedures}


We evaluated both models based on[cite: 121]:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Accuracy calculation on the validation set
    \item Learning curves for loss and accuracy over epochs
    \item Confusion matrices and per-class accuracy plots
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Results:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{MLP:} Achieved moderate performance with a best validation accuracy of 53.97\%[cite: 121]. It struggled particularly with visually similar classes such as cat vs dog and truck vs automobile[cite: 122]. Per-class accuracy was lower for animals like cat, bird, and deer[cite: 123].
    \item \textbf{CNN:} Achieved significantly better results, with a best validation accuracy of 77.79\%[cite: 124]. The model demonstrated consistent learning improvement across epochs[cite: 125]. It clearly outperformed MLP, leveraging convolution and pooling layers to learn spatial features more effectively[cite: 126].
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}


\subsection{MLP Model}
The MLP model was trained for 10 epochs[cite: 128].
\begin{itemize}
    \item Its training accuracy started at 41.77\% and reached 76.38\%[cite: 129].
    \item The validation accuracy began at 46.97\% and achieved a best of 53.97\%[cite: 129].
    \item The training loss showed a steady decrease[cite: 129].
    \item However, the validation loss started to increase towards the end, indicating overfitting[cite: 130]. This is visible in the "Loss over epochs of MLP" plot[cite: 131].
\end{itemize}

    \label{fig:mlp_loss_acc_3}
\end{figure}


\subsection{CNN Model}
The CNN model was also trained for 10 epochs[cite: 133].
\begin{itemize}
    \item It displayed a more effective learning pattern, with training accuracy rising to 81.37\%[cite: 134].
    \item Validation accuracy showed substantial improvement, reaching a best of 77.79\%[cite: 135].
    \item The training loss reduced significantly[cite: 135].
    \item The validation loss also saw a more consistent decrease, suggesting better generalization compared to the MLP[cite: 136]. The validation loss tracked the training loss more closely[cite: 137].
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Error Analysis}


\textbf{MLP Confusion Matrix Insights:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Overall Poor Performance:} The MLP misclassifies a significant number of samples[cite: 139]. For example, only 450 "bird" and 428 "cat" images were correctly classified[cite: 140].
    \item \textbf{Common Error Patterns:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Confusion between visually similar classes like "cat" vs "dog", "automobile" vs "truck", and "airplane" vs "ship" was frequent[cite: 141].
            \item Classes like "bird" were confused with "deer", "cat", "dog", and "frog", likely due to general shape or background similarities[cite: 142]. "Deer" was heavily confused with "bird" and "dog"[cite: 143].
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Inability to Capture Fine-Grained Details:} The MLP struggles to differentiate based on subtle features[cite: 144].
\end{itemize}
These errors are characteristic of MLP limitations: loss of spatial information[cite: 146], lack of hierarchical feature learning[cite: 147], and no translation invariance[cite: 149].


\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Screenshot 2025-05-24 183428.png} % Requires mlp_confusion_matrix.png
    \caption{MLP Confusion Matrix - Validation Set (Discussion - Likely P16/P22).}
    \label{fig:mlp_confusion_3}
\end{figure}




\textbf{CNN Confusion Matrix Insights:}
Examining the CNN's (likely) confusion matrix (the one from P9/P19):
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Superior Performance:} The CNN classifies images much more accurately than the MLP[cite: 152]. For instance, "airplane" corrections went from 581 (MLP) to 597 (CNN), "automobile" from 596 to 647, and "ship" from 649 to 727[cite: 153].
    \item \textbf{Reduced but Persistent Error Patterns:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Visually Similar Classes: Confusion between highly similar classes is reduced but still present[cite: 153]. The most notable is "cat" and "dog," where the CNN misclassified 251 "dog" images as "cat" and 137 "cat" images as "dog"[cite: 154]. "Automobile" and "truck" also still show confusion (127 "automobile" as "truck", 183 "truck" as "automobile")[cite: 155].
            \item Fine-Grained Distinctions: While better, the CNN can still struggle with very subtle differences or high intra-class variation[cite: 156]. For example, "bird" is still confused with "airplane" (90 times), "deer" (159 times), "cat" (80 times), and "frog" (86 times)[cite: 157]. *(Note: These numbers (251, 137, 127, 183, 90, 159, 80, 86) appear to come from the P16/MLP matrix in the PDF's text analysis - this indicates a potential error/confusion in the PDF's own analysis, as P9/P19 has different numbers. We follow the PDF text here.)*
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The CNN's improvement stems from its architecture: preservation of spatial information[cite: 160], hierarchical feature learning[cite: 162], and translation invariance[cite: 163].

    \label{fig:cnn_confusion_3}
\end{figure}




\subsection{Architectural Impact on Performance}


The performance disparity is due to differing architectures[cite: 168].
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{MLP Limitations:} Flattening discards spatial relationships[cite: 169], making it hard to learn local patterns or hierarchies[cite: 170]. Its lack of inductive bias makes it less efficient for images[cite: 171]. Its 53.97\% accuracy indicates its struggle[cite: 173].
    \item \textbf{CNN Strengths:} CNNs are designed for grid-like data[cite: 175]. The SimpleCNN used here consists of three convolutional blocks followed by a classifier[cite: 176].
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Convolutional Layers:} These layers use learnable filters (3x3 kernels in this CNN) to scan the input, detecting local patterns and creating feature maps that maintain spatial information[cite: 177]. Stacking these layers (three blocks in this model, with channels progressing from 3 to 32, then 64, then 128) allows the network to learn a hierarchy of features[cite: 178]. Each convolutional layer is followed by BatchNorm2d and ReLU activation[cite: 179].
            \item \textbf{Parameter Sharing:} Filters are shared across spatial locations in a feature map, reducing the total parameters compared to an MLP and making learning more efficient and robust to feature translation[cite: 180].
            \item \textbf{Pooling Layers:} Max pooling layers ($2\times2$ with stride 2) are used after the first two convolutional blocks in this CNN (after the 32-channel and 64-channel convolutions), reducing feature map dimensionality and providing some translation invariance[cite: 181]. A max pooling layer is also used after the third convolutional block (128-channel) before flattening for the classifier[cite: 182].
            \item \textbf{Regularization:} Dropout layers (with a rate of 0.2) are included after the first two convolutional blocks, which helps in preventing overfitting[cite: 183].
            \item \textbf{Classifier:} After the feature extraction by convolutional and pooling layers, the output is flattened and passed through fully connected layers ($128 \times 4 \times 4 \rightarrow 128 \rightarrow 10$) with ReLU activation for the final classification[cite: 184].
        \end{itemize}
    The CNN's architecture is better for image features, resulting in 77.79\% accuracy[cite: 185].
\end{itemize}


% --- Conclusion ---
\section{Conclusion}


This project successfully implemented and evaluated an MLP and a CNN for image classification on CIFAR-10[cite: 187]. The results show the superior efficacy of the CNN[cite: 188]. The CNN achieved 77.79\% best validation accuracy, while the MLP only reached 53.97\%[cite: 189, 190].


This disparity highlights CNNs' architectural advantages[cite: 191]. CNNs leverage spatial hierarchies via convolutional and pooling layers[cite: 192], while MLPs discard spatial information by flattening images[cite: 193], impeding performance on complex visual patterns[cite: 194].


In conclusion, CNNs are exceptionally well-suited for computer vision due to their specialized architecture[cite: 195]. Choosing an architecture aligned with data characteristics is crucial in deep learning[cite: 196].
